            The Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013,
             it is the successor to Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox series. It was first 
             released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013
              and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox
               game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. 
               Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", hence the name
                "Xbox One".[18][19] An eighth-generation console, it mainly competed against Sony's 
                PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and later the Switch.

            Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift 
            back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing
             Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One's controller was redesigned over the
              Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad, and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic
               feedback. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking
                features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream
                 directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games can also be played off-console via
                  a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices. The console can play Blu-ray Disc, 
                  and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for
                   digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally 
                   included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing improved
                    motion tracking and voice recognition.
