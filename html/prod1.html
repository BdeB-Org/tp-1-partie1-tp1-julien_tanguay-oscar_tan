            The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
             Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15,
              2013, in North America, November 29, 2013, in Europe, South America, and Australia, and on February
               22, 2014, in Japan. A console of the eighth generation, it competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and 
               Nintendo's Wii U and Switch.
               <br><br>
            Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an 
            AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak 
            at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation
             4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, 
             including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices 
             ("Remote Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay 
             remotely ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 
             3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console 
             also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.
