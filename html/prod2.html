            The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
             It was announced as the successor to the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12,
              2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, and was released worldwide
               one week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's 
               Xbox Series X/S consoles, which were released in the same month.

            The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition 
            lacks this drive, as a lower-cost model for buying games only through download. The two variants were launched
             simultaneously. Slimmer hardware revisions of both models replaced the original models on sale in November 2023.[4]
